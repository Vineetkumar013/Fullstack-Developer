1. POST request using http
    let str = ""
    req.on("data", (packet) => {
        str += packet;
    })
    req.on("end", () => {
        console.log(str)
    })


2. Streams -
  
    const movieStream = fs.createReadStream("./dummy.txt", {encoding:"utf-8"})
    movieStream.pipe(res)


3. Express -
    using http module of node
     1. code was very messy
     2. we had to handle different methods + routes;
         if(req.url === "/adddata" && req.method === "POST")
     3. getting the data from the clietn/handling post request;
        req.data -> 
     4. res.write, res.end

    built over the top of the "http module" of node itself;
    //nodemon - MERN stack

   
4. Data from backend/api response
      -> obj -> stringfied it
      ->JSON format/Stringified format
       -> JSON.parse(data) - object


       Networking -> client -> server -> String/array of bytes
